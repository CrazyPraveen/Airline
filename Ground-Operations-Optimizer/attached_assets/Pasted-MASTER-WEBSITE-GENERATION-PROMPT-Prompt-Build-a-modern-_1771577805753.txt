MASTER WEBSITE GENERATION PROMPT
Prompt:
Build a modern, high-performance, fully responsive React website (using React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion animations) for an aviation operations intelligence system called:
✈️ "IndiGround AI – Smart Turnaround Intelligence System"
The platform solves turnaround time (TAT) delays at high-traffic airports.
🎯 Core Objective
Airlines lose $65 per minute (~₹5,400) for every delay.
The system must:
Predict Actual Turnaround Time before landing.
Detect potential delay risks.
Recommend which ground resource to prioritize:
🧳 Baggage
⛽ Fuel
🍽 Catering
Minimize total financial penalty across active gates.
💎 UI / UX REQUIREMENTS (Very Important)
Create a premium competition-level interface with:
Glassmorphism cards
Gradient backgrounds (dark aviation theme – navy, indigo, neon blue accents)
Smooth page transitions
Framer Motion animations
Animated charts
Floating subtle background aviation graphics
Clean dashboard layout
Micro-interactions on hover
Animated counters for financial loss
Responsive mobile + tablet + desktop layout
Use:
Tailwind CSS
Framer Motion
Recharts (for graphs)
Lucide icons
Modern dashboard layout
🖥️ Website Structure
1️⃣ Landing Page (Animated Hero Section)
Hero section with:
Title:
“Transforming Analog Ground Operations into AI-Powered Precision”
Subtitle:
Reduce Turnaround Delays. Minimize Financial Penalties. Optimize Resources in Real Time.
Include:
Animated airplane landing illustration
Animated statistics counter:
Avg Delay Cost Today
Active Flights
Predicted Delays
Call-to-action button:
"Launch Control Dashboard"
Smooth scroll transition to dashboard.
2️⃣ Predictive TAT Model Section
Interactive prediction panel:
Inputs:
Aircraft Type (Dropdown)
Arrival Delay (minutes)
Baggage Availability (%)
Fuel Truck Availability (%)
Catering Readiness (%)
On clicking Predict TAT:
Display:
Predicted Turnaround Time
Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
Estimated Financial Impact
Delay Probability %
Animate results with scaling + glow effect.
3️⃣ Dynamic Resource Dashboard
This is the MAIN highlight section.
Create a control tower-style dashboard with:
Top Metrics Bar:
Active Flights
Flights at Risk
Total Delay Minutes
Estimated Financial Loss (Animated counter)
Gate View Panel:
Show cards for multiple gates:
Gate A1
Flight ID
Aircraft Type
Predicted TAT
Delay Risk Indicator (Color-coded)
Resource Bottleneck Detected
Example:
⚠️ Catering Delay Risk
⛽ Fuel Stable
🧳 Baggage Moderate
AI Recommendation Panel (Must Look Smart)
If delay predicted:
Show dynamic recommendation:
Example:
"Prioritize Catering Crew for Flight 6E-482 at Gate A1.
Estimated savings: $1,950"
Include:
Highlight animation
Pulsing alert card
Visual comparison:
If Baggage prioritized → Loss X
If Fuel prioritized → Loss Y
Recommended → Minimum Loss
4️⃣ Financial Impact Simulation Section
Interactive slider:
“Simulate Delay (minutes)”
As slider increases:
Show real-time financial loss animation
Graph updating dynamically
Show cascading impact visualization
Add animated line chart:
Delay vs Financial Cost
5️⃣ Real-Time Operations Overview
Include:
Live status timeline (animated progress bars)
Resource utilization bars
Turnaround breakdown pie chart:
Baggage %
Fuel %
Catering %
Boarding %
🧠 Predictive Model Logic (Frontend Mock Logic)
Simulate prediction logic:
Predicted_TAT =
Base_TAT (by aircraft type)
(Arrival_Delay × 0.8)
Resource Delay Factor
If:
Arrival Delay > 15 AND Catering < 60%
→ High Risk
System should dynamically recommend:
Resource with highest marginal delay contribution.
